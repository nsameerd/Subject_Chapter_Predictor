# Subject Classification Model Comparison

This project focuses on training and evaluating various machine learning models for classifying text questions into different subjects. It provides scripts for both model training and performance evaluation on a test dataset.




## Project Structure

- `train_subject_model.py`: Script to train and evaluate multiple machine learning classifiers for subject prediction.
- `predict_subject.py`: Script to load trained models and evaluate their performance on a test dataset.
- `subjects-questions.csv`: Dataset containing questions and their corresponding subjects (expected in the same directory as the scripts).
- `model_*.pkl`: Trained model files, generated by `train_subject_model.py` (e.g., `model_svm_poly.pkl`).




## Setup

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd <repository_name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**

    It is recommended to use a virtual environment.

    ```bash
    pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
    ```

3.  **Prepare data:**

    Ensure you have the `subjects-questions.csv` file in the root directory of the project. This file should contain at least two columns: `eng` (for the text questions) and `Subject` (for the corresponding subject labels).




## Usage

### Training and Evaluating Models

To train and evaluate the various subject classification models, run the `train_subject_model.py` script:

```bash
python train_subject_model.py
```

This script will:
- Load the `subjects-questions.csv` dataset.
- Split the data into training and validation sets.
- Train and evaluate the following classifiers:
    - SVM (Polynomial Kernel)
    - SVM (RBF Kernel)
    - Logistic Regression
    - Multinomial Naive Bayes
    - Random Forest
    - K-Nearest Neighbors
- Save each trained model as a `.pkl` file (e.g., `model_svm_poly.pkl`) in the project directory.
- Print the accuracy of each model on the validation set.




### Evaluating Models on Test Data

To evaluate the performance of the trained models on a test dataset, run the `predict_subject.py` script:

```bash
python predict_subject.py
```

This script will:
- Load the first 1000 entries from `subjects-questions.csv` as test data.
- Attempt to load each of the trained models (SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.).
- Make predictions on the test data using each loaded model.
- Print the accuracy of each model on the test set.

**Note:** Ensure that `train_subject_model.py` has been run first to generate the model `.pkl` files before running `predict_subject.py`.
